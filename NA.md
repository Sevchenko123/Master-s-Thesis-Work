####The high betweenness centrality, relatively high closeness centrality and network density as compared to normal member projection network; Lower diameter, weak negative degree assortativity and small average path lengths may be indicative of core-periphery structure in blocked member projection network.

####On the contrary, the extremely low closeness centrality and weak positive degree assortativity may indicate absence of core-periphery structure in normal member projection network.
